London, together with Geneva and Zurich, has the highest average cost of an apartment in Europe in the 1st quarter 2022: 13.593,52£ per square meter.

There are many factors to understand this price incursion: economic, demographic and endogenous. In this project we are going to focus on the latter and with the help of exploratory statistical analysis, to create a model capable of predicting house prices in the London area and its neighboring districts.

After the application of the model is finished, we hope that the following questions can be answered:  

- is the age of the house relevant?
- how important is the surface of the house? and the rooms?
- is it only the surface or also the location that determines the price of a home?
- is the availability of a garage a relevant criterion when considering the purchase?
- having comforts such as a central heating system really increases the value of a home?

Let's see what the analysis we are going to carry out next, says.
